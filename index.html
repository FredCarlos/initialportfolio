  <h2>Short Bio.</h2>

    <div class="write-up">
          <p>I have been in the aviation industry since 2014. After working as an engineer for 2 years in a semiconductor company. 
          I transitioned again to become a student once more to follow my dreams.
        After gaining teaching experience and additional flight hours from being an instructor, I was able to join an airline in 2019. 
          But then the world stopped due to the global pandemic.</p>
        <p>Bills are waving so I had to do something. I ventured into DIY Woodworking and eventually, this became my small business. 
          Along with learning about furniture making, I also learned how to be a content creator.</p>
        <p>My longtime girlfriend and I got married this year 2022 after many delays caused by the pandemic. Custom furniture making is not that stable enough to support us. 
          I dug deep and tapped into my IT/Programming background. 
        I have a moderate experience in IT and Programming back when I was still working as an engineer, so this was the time to follow up and add more knowledge in a 
          field of study that I was in before I became a pilot.</p>
        <p>In this day in age, a person should not limit himself/herself to one field of study. One must not be afraid to try and learn new things. And the most important 
          thing to remember is don‚Äôt be afraid to try, be more afraid of not trying.</p>

    <h2>My Skills.</h2>
    
    <div class="skill-row">
      <img class="webdev" src="img/web.jpg" alt="">
      <h3>Web Developer</h3>
      <p>Shifting careers is hard, especially if the chosen career to fall back into is fast-paced. 
        I learned HTML back in college but decided to pursue another career path.  
        With a little motivation and Udemy, it‚Äôs never too late to get into web development. 
        I'm excited about this new direction in my career because it allows me to share what 
        I love most: Building and Designing.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="skill-row">
      <img class="py" src="img/python.jpg" alt="">
      <h3 class="python">Python Programming</h3>
      <p class="pyt">Learned this programming language in Udemy. After my work as an engineer, I guess my curiosity about 
        automation and machine learning stuck with me. As a bonus at the moment, some or most industries are now transitioning and 
        implementing some type of automation, machine learning and artificial intelligence to their workflow.</p>

      <h3>Pilot</h3>
      <p>It‚Äôs a dream job not only for me but for many others out there. I mean who would not like a job that requires 
        you to stare out the window most of the time and get paid? After earning my wings, I became an instructor. 
        Promoted as Chief Flight Instructor before I had the opportunity to join a local airline. 
        But the global pandemic put the world to a standstill. Hopefully, someday I could return to the friendly skies 
        delivering passengers to their destinations as safely as possible.</p>

      <h3 class="woods">Woodworking</h3>
      <p class="carpenter">A way to fight boredom during the lockdown days of the global pandemic. 
        Curiosity turned into a hobby and turned into a small business all thanks to YouTube University. 
        I also partnered this hobby with learning how to document and how to be a content creator as well.

      <h3>Electronics Engineering</h3>
      <p>Graduated from Mapua Institute of Technology way back in 2010. During my stay in school, learned the basics of programming using C++, and HTML. 
        Also learned Network Engineering as my specialization. 
        After graduation, I was able to secure a job in a Semiconductor company and was fortunate enough to apply all the things 
        I learned in a real-world setting.</p>
